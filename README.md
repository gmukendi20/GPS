# GPS
GPS (Global Positioning System) is a satellite-based navigation system that provides location, time, and velocity data anywhere on Earth. It works by communicating with a network of satellites that orbit the planet. GPS devices or apps calculate their position by analyzing signals from multiple satellites.
